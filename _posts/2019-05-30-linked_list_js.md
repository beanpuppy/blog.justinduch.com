What up idiots, today we're making a linked list in JavaScript. Why you may
ask? The answer to that question is too personal for the internet, so I'll
just say that I don't like to be proven wrong. If you don't know what a linked
list is, you'll probably figure it out as you read along.

Also since I've given up on trying to get Pygments to syntax highlight the
code in my pre tags, I'm now going to be using [carbon.now.sh][] to show you
the code as pretty pictures.

[carbon.now.sh]: https://carbon.now.sh

Because I'm lazy, this is only going to be a singly-linked list, but it still
better than nothing and enough to prove my point. Let's start at the start.

This is the start. Self-explanatory.

Look at those `push` and `pop` methods! I even added comments so your stupid
monkey brain can understand it. This is already technically a linked list, but
while I'm here educating your dumb ass, let's go even ***FURTHER***.

Now there's a `tail` attribute and we can `append` and `popBack` the tail!
What!? *HOW FAR WILL THIS MAN GO!?*

Look I even added tests!! *are you haPPY NOW?!!! **HUH `<Name Redacted>`, ARE YOU
HAPPY!!?* LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. YOU MADE ME DO THIS.**
NOW DON'T YOU EVER DARE TO COME INTO MY HOUSE AND CHALLENGE ME AGAIN.

**P.S.** Give back my dolphin plushie to me or I will burn down your house.
