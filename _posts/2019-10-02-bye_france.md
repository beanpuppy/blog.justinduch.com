title: Québec Wants To Preserve The French Language, I Want To Destroy It

The Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF), or the Québec Board of the
French Language, is a public organization established in the province on March
24, 1961. Part of its initial mission was to “work on the normalization of the
language in Québec and support state intervention to carry out a global
language policy that would consider notably the importance of socio-economic
motivations in making French the priority language in Québec.”[^1]

I find this unacceptable. French should stay in France! Québec is in Canada so
they should be speaking CANADIAN! As someone who got their education in
linguistics from body building forums, this deeply saddens and offends me.
That's why I've taken it upon myself to pledge to destroy the French language
and restore peace to the world.

Now, I'm not an unreasonable person, I know I'm not going to be able to stop
French people speaking French, climate change will do that for me. But I must
stop non French people from learning French. How you ask? Well let me tell
you.

## Première Partie: De-legitimise the French Language

A very simple misinformation campaign condemning French should do the trick.
We've seen this strategy used by the CCP in China to attack Hong Kong by
reporting that speaking Cantonese can cause nasal and sinus cancer.[^2]

We could taken even more work from China when a group from the First
China International Frontier Education Summit "concluded that English [and
all other Western languages] is actually a Chinese dialect".[^3] This
revolutionary discovery supported by HARD EVIDENCE completely invalidates
French as it's just a worse version of Mandarin.

## Part Deux: Stop All French Cultural Exports

When I was a boy, I went to the baker to buy a baguette because it was the
only bread that reminded me of a dick. I didn't expect to finish it as I don't
eat very much and it was pretty big, but I ate the entire thing in an
afternoon completely by itself. This is why I learnt French and I'm sure it's
many other people's reason too.

France has shipped US$568.4 billion worth of goods around the globe in 2018.[^4] This is terrible if we want people to think France is the worst.
That is at least OVER 600 baguettes!!

**600 PEOPLE WHO NOW WANT TO LEARN FRENCH BECAUSE THE DICK BREAD TASTED SO
GOOD!**

The big issue here is that I don't know how to get around this. How do am I,
someone only armed with a dream, supposed to stop this? I know I said I would
let climate change take care of France but that was only because I don't have
any nukes. Unless...?

## Part Trois: Become World Leader

Unfortunately, wikiHow doesn't have a article on becoming a world leader so
I'm kinda in the dark here. However, I've thought of a loophole! Do you
remember this famous quote from the book Dune: _"He who controls the spice
controls the universe"_? Herbert was of course referencing to LATE-STAGE
CAPITALISM.

THAT'S RIGHT! THIS IS JUST ANOTHER POST OF ME SHITTING ON CAPITALISM!

All we need to do is become part of the bourgeoisie and now we control the
world! My personal favourite way of becoming rich is exploiting the
environment so much that the Earth will eventually become uninhabitable.

Great! Now that we have a monopoly on the toilet paper industry and more money
than every country in the EU combined, we can continue our plan.

## Part Quatre: Bye Bye France

While researching the most comfortable toilet paper material, we built a
nuclear fission plant (for tax evasion purposes of course) in Zimbabwe (so we
can exploit poor people). With our new knowledge we can build nukes and... you
know were this is going.

> Au revoir France.

## Part Cinq: We're Not Done Yet

With French being an extinct language, you can be sure some pesky linguist
from the future is going to try and re-discover it. We can't let this happen!

Apparently, technology is a big player in helping to decipher dead languages.[^5]
So the easy solution here would be to just destroy all technology by nuking
the rest of the world. Fortunately for us, since we destroyed so much of the
environment already, there's no way for humans to ever create the machines
needed to reach this point ever again!

## Finale

Now we can sit back in our Mars habitat (for rich people only) and watch a new
Earth grateful it has been rid of the French language. Go suck a baguette
Québec.
