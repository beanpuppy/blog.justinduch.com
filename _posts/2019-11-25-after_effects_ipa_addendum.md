title: A Written Guide To Adobe After Effects But It's A Phonetic Transcription [Addendum]

This is an addendum to my previous post which you can read
[here](/post/after_effects_ipa).

Fun fact: The post was actually going to be a serious guide to After Effects
but I got bored a quarter of the way in and decided to practice memorising the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) instead.

And that's when this great idea hit me:

> What if I combine these two ideas into one shitty post?

Just to be clear in case you were going into this post expecting it; I'm not going
to convert it back into English, I'm leaving it as an exercise for you. You can use
[this chart](http://www.ipachart.com) to help you.

To transcribe the post I used [this website](https://tophonetics.com) which was able
to transcribe most of the words. It basically just has a dictionary database of English
words and replaces it with it's phonetic transcription. There were a few words that
weren't in it's database, so I had to them transcribe myself.

One of which is: PragerU. If you are wondering why I mentioned PragerU in a post about
Adobe After Effects you should transcribe it for yourself to read. Or re-read. It has
layers.

Anyway let's get into the transcription for PragerU /preɪgə'juː/:

- Plosive, bilabial: /p/ (**p**ut)
- Trill, alveolar: /r/ (**r**ay)
- Diphthong: /eɪ/ (b**ai**t)
- Plosive, velar: /g/ (**g**ot)
- Schwa: /ə/ (**a**bout)
- Approximant, palatal: /j/ (**y**acht)
- Close, back: /uː/ (b**oo**t)

This is all pretty basic stuff, the phoneme is between the slashes (/) and the pronunciation
is the bold parts of the words in the parentheses. One thing I wasn't too sure on was the syllable
stress which is denoted by the straight single quote ('). As you can see I put it before the /juː/
or 'U' which may not be correct. I assumed this had stress because it was capitalised, but I think the
stress could also be at the start like it many other words. If this is wrong please tell me!

Another word was: dumbass /ˈdʌm.æs/. Again if you a wondering why that word is in a guide about After
Effects, please read it. I'm too lazy to go into each phoneme again so I'll leave it as another
exercise for you ;)

Side note: I don't know what an addendum is. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addendum),
it's "an addition required to be made to a document by its author subsequent to its printing or publication".
I have no idea if this counts as an addendum.
