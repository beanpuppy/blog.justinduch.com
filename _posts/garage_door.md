1. Play video games: You know how you have over 500 games on Steam, but have only played 20% of them? You should try to play some… wait, what are you doing? Did you just buy the new Fire Emblem? But you still have 400 games to play! I don’t care if you want more waifus! STOP BUYING MORE GAMES! YOU HAVEN’T EVEN FINISHED DEATH STRANDING!
2. Think about fixing the garage door: You’re not going to do it, but it’s fun to think about.
3. Cook some food: First open the fridge to see what’s inside... oh it’s just eggs. No worries let’s go to the shops to get... oh right, never mind. I suppose I could have an egg in these trying times.
4. Play more Fire Emblem to forget about the fact that you’re getting hungry: Bernadette is my new waifu.
5. Look through the fridge again to see if food has magically appeared: Nope.
6. Think about getting Uber Eats: With a $20 delivery? No thanks.

10. Make an overly specific top 10 list: I'm So Meta, Even This Acronym.
