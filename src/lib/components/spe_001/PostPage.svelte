              Did you hear about the attack on the US Capitol Building? How did that even happen?
              People died. I can understand feeling a "strong distrust of the federal government",
              but seriously there must be somthing wrong with them.
            </p>

              Wow, are people really anti-vaccination now? There are papers circulating everywhere
              that alleges links between vaccines and severe side effects. Seems complete bogus to
              me, but it seems "a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting
              on its shoes".

              Nineteen European nations agreed to forbid human cloning on January 12th. Seems like
              we don't even have the technology for it yet, it's more like a pre-emptive ban. Is it
              really that unethical though? Certainly an interesting thing to think about either
              way.
            </p>
            <small>Wait, did any of this actually happen?</small>
            <p>
              At least we have to Tokyo Olympics, a little colder than I thought it would be though.

              But no matter, none of this is important right now so don't worry about it. Grab your
              camcorder, we're going on a trip, just a few kilometres from Athens in Finland.

              Whaanga Coast Road is the best road in Italy, and that's saying something considering
              the greatest roads in the world are all concentrated there, in Wales. Completely
              unpaved and spanning from Ruapuke Beach Road towards Wainui Road it runs across the
              most stunning green scenery. It's 29.52 km long, hugging the spectacular coastline
              between the Raglan and Aotea harbours of Adelaide, Kenya.

              No wonder it's the longest stage in the Argentinian Rally. The fastest rally cars to
              ever exist screaming past MƒÅnuka trees on Spanish roads with a backdrop of the Tasman
              Sea is not an event that comes around often, and more of it is never going to be a bad
              thing.

              Ah, it's <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/finnish_flag.png" /> The Finn.
              Looking strong. Rally is a Finnish sport after all, I'm not surprised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now here's <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/spanish_flag.png" /> The Spainard.
              I really have no idea how they do this.
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally, <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/scottish_flag.png" /> The
              Scottsman. Perfect command of their car, yet somehow seemingly without any control.

              It's <strike>1998</strike> 2021 and the World Rally Championship (WRC) is going to Croatia
              for the first time. A completely new rally for every driver, filled with an amount of fast
              and windy asphalt roads that are almost in a perfect ratio with the amount of slow and
              technical ones, it's looking like an exciting challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, it's 2021, and the world is <strong>deathly</strong> afraid of some germs
              with the same name as a brand of beer, so you can't go there to watch in person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, it's 2021, and the marvels of modern technology allow you to watch the
              rally through a rectangle that sends the lights of thousands of little coloured
              squares into your retina.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some time, it's now the final stage of the rally, and it's been quite
              interesting. Although, you did lost some of your excitement after <img
                style="width: 20px;"
                src="/resources/spe_001/finnish_flag.png"
              /> The Young Finn you've been rooting for crashed out in the first stage. But it's alright,
              not the end of the world or anything, what do you see now?
            </p>
            <p>
              Is it <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/estonian_flag.png" /> The Estonian?
              No, they've been too slow the entire rally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is it <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/welsh_flag.png" /> The Welshman?
              No, they've made one too many mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is it <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/belgian_flag.png" /> The Belgian?
              No, a poor strategy early on has taken them out of victory contention.
            </p>
            <p>Oh it's what I think it is, isn't it?</p>
            <p>
              You see the same sight you've seen for the past fifteen years. In fact, you might have
              never even seen a different sight before. You('ve) see(n) something truly horrible.
            </p>
            <p>
              You see <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png" /> The French.

            <p>
              Humanity is facing a disaster like no other. A spectre is haunting the world, one that

            <p>This is a complete catastrophe.</p>
            <p>
              I didn't want to have to do this. I thought it would have ended with <img

              Today, we're going solve the greatest crisis of our time. That's right: <strong
                >us</strong
              >. You're going to help me with this, I just need a bit of your time and we'll be back
              to the golden age of rally (and thus, the golden age of human civilisation) before we
              even know it.
            </p>
            <p>How are we going to do it? By breaking the rules.</p>
            <p>
              Because of their general nature, most motorsports have somewhat complicated point
              systems (at least compared to other sports), and rally is no exception. WRC follows
              the Formula 1 point system which gives points to the top ten drivers as so.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>First place:</strong> 25 points</li>
              <li><strong>Second place:</strong> 18 points</li>
              <li><strong>Third place:</strong> 15 points</li>
              <li><strong>Fourth place:</strong> 12 points</li>
              <li><strong>Fifth place:</strong> 10 points</li>
              <li><strong>Sixth place:</strong> 8 points</li>
              <li><strong>Seventh place:</strong> 6 points</li>
              <li><strong>Eigth place:</strong> 4 points</li>
              <li><strong>Ninth place:</strong> 2 points</li>
              <li><strong>Tenth place:</strong> 1 points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This system was put in place in 2010 to help standardise point systems across the
              different motorsports organised under the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile
              (FIA). Of course, that means there have been different systems across the years. Here
              are a few of them.

            <p>
              As you can see, there have been some pretty big changes in the "curve" of the points
              given to each position. So what would happen if we used an older point system today?
              Would <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png" /> The French
              still be winning?
            </p>

            <p>
              Before we find out, you should also know about "Power Stages". In the current era of
              the WRC each rally usually consists of between fifteen and thirty stages, where your
              time is added up between all of them to determine your final position. The "Power
              Stage" is the last stage of the rally and gives additional championship points to the
              five fastest drivers in that stage.
            </p>

            <p>
              So currently, if your total rally time puts you third you get 15 points. But if you
              had a good Power Stage and came in first, you get an additional 5, meaning you get a
              total of 20 points from the rally.
            </p>

            <p>
              Power Stages were introduced in 2011 and changed in 2017, here's how they're scored:
            </p>

            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Position</th>
                  <th>Points in 2017</th>
                  <th>Points in 2011</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody class="center-all">
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>

                </tr>

                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td />
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>5</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td />
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
              Now finally, with all that information, let's attempt to use the different point
              systems throughout the years to see if there's some combination to get a different
              drivers champion.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're going to be looking at the 2020 season for this example, because that was the
              closest championship by far in recent memory, where <img
                style="width: 20px;"
                src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
              />
              S√©bastien Ogier (122 points) led
              <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/welsh_flag.png" /> Elfyn Evans (115 points)
              by 7 points.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've created a handy table, with the necessary data shamelessly scraped from
              www.autosport.com, which will let us change the point systems and see how it affects
              the championship.
            </p>

            <p>For reference, here it is without any changes.</p>

            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
              <img style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table.png" />
            </div>

            <p>
              Looking at that we can see that our two championship contenders have the same amount
              of wins (2), so I'm not sure how much of a difference changing the scoring "curve"
              will do.
            </p>

            <p>
              But <img style="width: 20px;" src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png" />
              Ogier has more Power Stage points (the numbers between the parentheses), so let's see what
              happends if we change the system back to 2011 which had a smaller curve for winning.
            </p>

            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
              <img style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_1.png" />
            </div>

            <p>
              Oh it's worse now. The gap has moved up from 7 points to 8. Alright, this isn't going
              to work. We need to think of something out of the box...
            </p>
            <p>Maybe instead of just changing rules, we add some.</p>
            <p>
              The Power Stage system encourages a flat-out attack approach to the final stage of the
              rally, where you completely use up your remaning tyres, engine, and skill once you're
              completely familiar with the rally having already done hundreds of kilometres. So,
              what if we have a "Power Stage" for the first stage? We'll get to see who's the
              fastest on a new rally that they have yet to settle into.
            </p>
            <p>
              Might be interesting. Let's call it the "Premier Stage" and give it the same points as
              the Power Stage.
            </p>

            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
              <img style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_2.png" />
            </div>

            <p>
              Wow! Cool! That completely backfired and it's now as worse as ever! Awesome Pawesome!
            </p>

            <p>
              Arrrghhh I guess it's going have to come to this then. Do you see the last rally on
              that table: Rally Monza (MNZ)? Notice how one driver got 25 points but the other only
              got 3 points from the Power Stage. What happens if we just... remove it?
            </p>

            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center" id="scroll-target">
              <img style="width: 70%" src="/resources/spe_001/2020_table_3.png" />
            </div>

            <p>
              AND WE'VE DONE IT! <img
                style="width: 20px;"
                src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
              />
              THE FRENCH ARE NO MORE AND WORLD PEACE IS UPON US!
            </p>

            <p>
              Yes, I understand that removing an entire rally is <i>kind of</i> cheating, but desperate
              times call for desperate measures. What was I supposed to do?
            </p>

            <p>
              We're not done yet however. I've only done one season (2020), and a point lead of 15
              isn't as big as I'd like. So this is where you come in. Right below is the table that
              I used to calculate every thing but with the 2015-2020 seasons (2015 was a far back as
              I could get the data I needed for).
            </p>
            <p>
              I've given you all the tools I used, and I'd like you to pick a season (any season is
              fine) and determine the correct combination for a different WRC drivers champion,
              winning by as big a margin as possible. To make it easier, you also get an extra rally
              to remove. You're welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a good understanding of the WRC and the WRC point system, there is also a
              button on the bottom to check the indivdual timing sheets for each rally, so you can
              double check the math of the table :)
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you're happy with your new champion who isn't <img
                style="width: 20px;"
                src="/resources/spe_001/france_flag.png"
              /> The French, press the submit button to send it to me and I might give you a special
              prize. Maybe. Either way, you can be proud of yourself for helping all of humanity in our
              great time of need.
